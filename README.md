# Simple Python Package

A simple template for a Python package, based on my own preferences.

## Features

Current features:

- CLI entry points with basic options for verbose, force-overwrite, debug, and dry-run
- Logging with nice output
- A few command line utils including parallel command execution
- Setuptools for simple installation
- Basic test file

Not a feature (yet?):

- Auto-generating documentation
- Better structure for unit tests
- `tqdm` support for parallel processing
- YAML-based config
- Automatic version bumping

## Requirements

- [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)
